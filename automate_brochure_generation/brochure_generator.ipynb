    "\n",
    "In this project, we built a highly efficient brouchure generator using LLM. We also added the option of translating the generated brochure. The solution process can be divided into three main stages. To build our graphical interface we used gradio wich is an open-source Python framework that simplifies the creation of interactive web interfaces for machine learning models, APIs, or any Python function\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first step is to build a website scrapper that can retrieve the content of a given url website.\n",
    "* After scrapping the website, we'll send the useful website content to an LLM model. The LLM model will generate a brochure by summarizing and extracting the useful information. We choose Chatgpt and Claude to do this task.\n",
    "* The final step is to send the generated brochure to another LLM for translation into the desired language.In our context, we decided to translate it into French.\n",
