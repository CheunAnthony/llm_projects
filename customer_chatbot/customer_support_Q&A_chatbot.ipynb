You head over to your file manager to delete the large files which you no longer require, but you have no clue which of them are occupying most of your disk space. In this article, we will show some easy methods to check disk usage in Linux from both the terminal and the GUI application.\\n\\nCheck Disk Space Using the df Command\\n\\nIn Linux, there are many commands to check disk usage, the most common being the df command. The df stands for “Disk Filesystem” in the command, which is a handy way to check the current disk usage and the available disk space in Linux. The syntax for the df command in Linux is as follows:\\n\\ndf <options> <file_system>')"
